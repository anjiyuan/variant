# variantCalling: Variant Calling from RANseq data

Induced mutagenesis is commonly used to the finding of genetic variation/new allelic variants (Chaudhary et al. 2019)1. This tool is used to detect variants in forward genetic screens and transgene organism from RNAseq data. Unlike most Mapping-by-sequencing strategies, this tool accepts standard mapping data format bam and generated text of all homozygous and heterozygous variants, including SNP and InDel. The bam file can be visualized in RNAseqBrowser:

## quick start
1. run VariantCalling
    1. clone code (in windows terminal CMD or linux terminal) using 
    ```console
       >git clone https://github.com/anjiyuan/variant.git
    ```
    2. **Linux or MacOs:** 1. goto demoData filder 2. bash variant.sh
    3. **windows:** 1. goto demoData filder 2. double click variant.bat
